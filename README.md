Nbyula Takeaway Assignment 1
Mission
When it comes to scheduling meetings with others, tracking their
availability is a pain! What if there was an app that could track our
off-hours and availability, and help us and others schedule
appointments easily?

Objectives
$ Terraformers should be able to sign up and login to the app
$ Terraformers should be able to schedule an appointment with any
other terraformer on the platform
$ The appointment should contain: title, agenda, time, guest (the
other person with whom the appointment is to be scheduled)
$ Note that the appointment should only be scheduled if the guest
is available

$ Terraformers should be able to see their upcoming appointments
$ Terraformers should be able to update their profile name and
password from their profile page
$ Terraformers should be able to mark their off-hours from their

profile page (this is the time where they are not available for any
appointments during the day)

Expectations
$ The application should have a client and a server
$ Focus on making the application completely functional, edge cases
are important
$ Git history is paramount to us. The assignment should be available
on GitHub (or any other Git hosting solution) for us to review. Make
sure you follow all the best practices while using Git as you would
do on any production application
$ The assignment should be deployed for us to check. You could check
out Netlify, Vercel, Heroku or other hosting platforms for deploying
your assignment
$ We would love to hear about your design decisions, scalability
concerns, schemas and trade-offs (if any) that you come across while
working on the Assignment. Feel free to include a README.md with the
code
